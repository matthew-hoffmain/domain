## Acknowledgments

Special thanks to [Musopen](https://musopen.org/) for providing music for free use, with specific regards to the [Set Chopin Free](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/Musopen/set-chopin-free) project and the works of Frederic Chopin.

"His music is a gift shared by all of humanity, yet it's a gift that remains largely encumbered by DRM copyrights and other restrictions. We're now 164 years after Chopin's death. His music should be freely available to anyone anywhere in the world. I can't think of a greater tribute to Chopin's legacy than to ensure that everything he created exists for the world to enjoy, for free, forever." - Aaron Dunn, Musopen Founder
